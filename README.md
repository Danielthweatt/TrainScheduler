#Train Tracker
This is my first application using Firebase. 
##How to Use
Once the app is loaded, all train information (name, 
destination, arrival time, minutes away) stored in the 
database will be displayed on the page and will be 
dynamically updated every minute. If the user enters new 
train information, that will be stored in the database 
and automatically displayed on the page as well.
